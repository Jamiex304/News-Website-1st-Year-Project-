	<h3><b><u>Skyrim course to be offered by Rice University</u></b></h3>
	<img src="Skyrim-Alchemy.jpg" alt="Skyrim" width="570" />
	<p>The Department of English at Rice University can help you get your Fus Ro Degree! (pause for groans) 
	with their new course, “Scandinavian Fantasy Worlds: Old Norse Sagas and Skyrim,” spotted by Eurogamer. 
	This seems to be part of a trend in offering courses based on pop culture franchises, for obvious, 
	enrollment-based reasons.“This course has two goals,” the course description reads. “First, it introduces
	students to fantasy as both psychological concept and driving force in gamer culture; and second, using 
	these paradigms, it considers how and why medieval Scandinavia serves as a locus of modern Anglo-American 
	fantasy. To these ends, students will read selections from Old Norse and Old Icelandic sagas 
	(in translation) as they play different quests within Skyrim.”Now if only they’d offered a major in Thu’um
	back when I was applying…</p>

	<h3><b><u>Mass Effect 4 won’t include Shepard at all, says BioWare</u></b></h3>
	<img src="Mass-Effect-3.jpg" alt="Mass-effect" width="570" />
	<p>At some point between frantically disarming the 20th planet-devastating bomb and punching mono-gendered 
	aliens in their vestigial fringe in Mass Effect, I realized the notion of more than one hero safeguarding 
	the sprawling galaxy isn’t necessarily a bad thing. After all, it worked in Star Wars — not only did Luke 
	Skywalker’s heroics mature only at the very end of Return of the Jedi (before that he mostly sat around 
	complaining about power converters), they couldn’t happen without the just-as-potent heroism of the people 
	around him. To that end, BioWare Montreal Producer Fabrice Condominas told VG247 that Mass Effect 4 
	definitely won’t include Shepard in any capacity.“There is one thing we’re absolutely sure of: There’ll
	be no more Shepard, and the trilogy is over,” Conominas said. “This is really our starting point. The 
	Mass Effect universe is vast and very rich. So, at this point in time, we don’t even know what kind of 
	time frame we’re going to be in. All we’re doing is gathering ideas from the teams and gathering feedback.”
    BioWare confirmed the development of the sci-fi fourth-quel shortly after co-founders Ray Muzyka and Greg 
	Zeschuk split from gaming for good mid-September. Like the eternal mystery of why Shepard’s dance routine 
	never improves, scant details surround the project.“We don’t want to make ‘Shepard 2' or Mass Effect 4 
	with like, ‘Oh, there’s no more Shepard, but you’re a soldier in the universe’,” Conominas added. “So, 
	this will be a very different context for sure. Nothing has been decided on the rest.”</p>

	<h3><b><u>Tomb Raider lead writer sees “no reason” to avoid sensitive storytelling themes in games</u></b></h3>
	<img src="Tomb-Raider-controversy1.jpg" alt="Tomb" width="570" />
	<p>While fun is their primary goal, games often portray themes courting controversy as a means of conveying 
	more meaningful and mature experiences. Crystal Dynamics’ reboot of Tomb Raider pairs the franchise’s staple 
	action-heavy content with a younger, frightened, and more vulnerable Lara Croft — human-like traits of 
	weakness which came into focus after a particular scene within gameplay footage shown at this year’s E3 
	included an apparent rape attempt on the battered explorer. Crystal Dynamics later quieted the ensuing public 
	outcry by disproving any perceived themes of sexual assault, but in a new interview with GameSpot, Tomb Raider 
	Lead Writer Rhianna Pratchett sees “no reason” why general game storytelling shouldn’t touch upon sensitive 
	topics.</p>

	<h3><b><u>Saga Kingdoms launches Kickstarter page, quest system details revealed for the MMORTS</u></b></h3>
	<img src="saga.jpg" alt="saga" width="570" />
	<p>You may remember Saga, a 2008 MMORTS with collectible card game-like elements. Saga Kingdoms is the 
	continuation of that franchise, seeking to create a MMORTS with more of a focus on co-op and quests than the 
	pure PvP of contenders past. We have some early details on how this questing system will function.</p>
